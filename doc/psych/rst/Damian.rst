   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   Project Talent gave 440,000 US high school students a number of
   personality and ability tests. Of these, the data fror 346,000 were
   available for followup. Subsequent followups were collected 11 and 50
   years later. Marion Spengler and her colleagues Rodica Damian, and
   Brent Roberts reported on the stability and change across 50 years of
   personality and ability. Here is the correlation matrix of 25 of
   their variables (Spengler) as well as a slightly different set of 19
   variables (Damian). This is a nice example of mediation and
   regression from a correlation matrix. (Temporarily copied from
   psychTools to pass CRAN checks. )
