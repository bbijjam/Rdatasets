   The data uses the original codes given by the World Health
   Organization. The column names for columns five through 60 are made
   by combining ``new_`` to a code for method of diagnosis (``rel`` =
   relapse, ``sn`` = negative pulmonary smear, ``sp`` = positive
   pulmonary smear, ``ep`` = extrapulmonary) to a code for gender (``f``
   = female, ``m`` = male) to a code for age group (``014`` = 0-14 yrs
   of age, ``1524`` = 15-24 years of age, ``2534`` = 25 to 34 years of
   age, ``3544`` = 35 to 44 years of age, ``4554`` = 45 to 54 years of
   age, ``5564`` = 55 to 64 years of age, ``65`` = 65 years of age or
   older).
